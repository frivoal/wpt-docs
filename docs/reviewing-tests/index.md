title: Reviewing Tests
---

In order to encourage a high level of quality in the W3C test
suites, test contributions must be reviewed by a peer.


## Test Review Policy

The reviewer can be anyone (other than the original test author) that
has the required experience with both the spec under test and with the
test [format][format] and [style][style] guidelines.

The review must happen in public, but the exact review location is
flexible. In particular if a vendor is submitting tests that have
already been publicly reviewed in their own review system, that review
may be carried forward. For other tests, we strongly recommend using
either Reviewable or GitHub's built-in review tools.

Regardless of what review tool is used, the review must be clearly
linked in the pull request.

To assist with test reviews, a [review checklist][review-checklist]
is available.
